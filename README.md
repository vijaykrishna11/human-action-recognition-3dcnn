# Human Action Recognition using 3D CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on Semantic Human Action Recognition using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN).  
The model captures both spatial and temporal features from video sequences to classify human activities.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- 3D Convolutional Neural Network architecture
- Spatial and temporal feature extraction
- Transfer Learning implementation
- Global and Local Context Distillation
- Model training and evaluation using TensorFlow

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Plotly

## 🏗 Architecture
The system processes video input, performs preprocessing, extracts spatio-temporal features using 3D convolution layers, and classifies actions using a dense neural network.
